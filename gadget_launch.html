<strong><h1>SMART SPEAKERS</h1></strong></center>
<p>Smart speakers have rapidly transformed the way we interact with technology in our daily lives. These voice-activated devices, equipped with virtual assistants like Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri, allow users to play music, control smart home gadgets, get weather updates, set reminders, and even shop online—all through simple voice commands. As smart speakers become increasingly popular, they are not only changing convenience and entertainment but also raising new questions about privacy and the future of human-computer interaction.</p><!-- First introductory paragraph-->

<h3><ins>What Are Smart Speakers?</ins></h3>
<p>Smart speakers are wireless devices equipped with microphones, speakers, and built-in virtual assistants that respond to voice commands. Popular examples include Amazon Echo with Alexa, Google Nest with Google Assistant, and Apple HomePod with Siri. These devices connect to the internet and can perform a variety of tasks, making them a central hub for smart home automation and personal assistance.</p>
<h3><ins>How Do Smart Speakers Work?</ins></h3>
<p>Smart speakers use voice recognition technology to listen for a “wake word” such as “Alexa” or “Hey Google.” Once activated, the device processes the user’s voice command through cloud-based artificial intelligence, interpreting requests and responding accordingly. This could be anything from playing a song to providing news updates, controlling connected smart devices like lights and thermostats, or answering questions.</p>
